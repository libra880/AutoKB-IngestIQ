      "The increase in Event ID 4662 logs you're seeing is expected—it’s tied to enabling the Directory Service Access audit policy as part of Advanced Audit Configuration.",
      "These events aren’t generated by Microsoft Defender for Identity (MDI) itself. They originate from Windows auditing when Active Directory objects are accessed. Once this policy is enabled, the system begins logging those operations in more detail, which naturally increases the volume of 4662 events.",
      "MDI relies on this audit data to identify threats such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, and other advanced attack patterns. So, while the spike in logs may be noticeable, it reflects increased visibility and enhances the detection capabilities of Defender for Identity.",
      "There aren’t any configurable settings within Defender for Identity to reduce or control the volume of these events. The logging is driven by Windows audit policy once Directory Service Access is enabled.",
